## Project Overview
Heart Disease Prediction using Random Forest

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient health metrics.
The model is built using a Random Forest Classifier and implemented in Python inside a Google Colab notebook.

🚀 Project Features

Load dataset directly in Colab

Clean and preprocess raw data

Convert categorical features (e.g., ChestPainType) into numeric form

Train a Random Forest model

Evaluate using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix

Ready-to-use notebook for medical prediction research

📂 Dataset

Upload your dataset manually in Colab using:

from google.colab import files
files.upload()


The dataset must include standard heart disease features such as:

Age

Sex

ChestPainType

Resting Blood Pressure

Cholesterol

Fasting Blood Sugar

Resting ECG

Max Heart Rate

Exercise-Induced Angina

Oldpeak

ST_Slope

Target (0 = No disease, 1 = Disease)

🧹 Data Preprocessing

Main preprocessing steps:

Checking dataset structure

Handling missing values

Removing duplicates

Label encoding categorical features

Converting ChestPainType into numeric

Splitting dataset into train/test sets

Example:

from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

le = LabelEncoder()
df['ChestPainType'] = le.fit_transform(df['ChestPainType'])

🤖 Model Used: Random Forest

The prediction model:

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

📊 Model Evaluation

The notebook outputs:

Accuracy Score
Classification Report
Confusion Matrix


Example evaluation code:

from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))

📦 Installation

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn kaggle

▶️ How to Run

Open Google Colab

Upload the notebook:

Predicting_Heart_Disease_RF.ipynb


Upload your dataset when prompted

Run all cells sequentially

🧪 Output

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)  
- Google Colab  
- Kaggle Dataset
  
## Conclusion:
- The Random Forest model achieved good predictive accuracy on this dataset.
- Important factors influencing heart disease likely include Age, Chest Pain Type, and Cholesterol. 
- As we observed from the output and when we compared Age, Chest Pain Type, and Cholesterol to predict heart disease.
- Cholesterol is the most influential factor from Age and Chest Pain Type, or we can say that 
  Age < Chest Pain Type < Cholesterol based on most infuantial factor in predicting heart disease in our model.
- Model can be improved by performing hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) or testing other models.
